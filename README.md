# SimpleBuffedMobs
This is very simple plugin to make minecraft vanilla tiny bit more interesting. Especially at the start when you don't have endgame gear!

 

- Most of the mobs have 2x more health

- Spiders are much faster

- Creepers are charged and they explode 2x faster

- Skeletons have Iron Helmet so that they don't burn in daylight and have bow with Punch 2 and Flame enchantment

- Zombies have Leather Helmet so that they don't burn in daylight and have Stone Sword with Knockback 2 and Sharpness 2 enchantment

- Wither Skeletons have Netherite Boots and Netherite Sword

- and more!
